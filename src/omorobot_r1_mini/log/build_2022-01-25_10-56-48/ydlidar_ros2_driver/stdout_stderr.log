CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /omo_ws/src/omorobot_r1_mini/build/ydlidar_ros2_driver/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /workspaces/foxy_ws/src/omorobot_r1_mini/build/ydlidar_ros2_driver where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/omo_ws/src/omorobot_r1_mini/src/ydlidar_ros2_driver/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/workspaces/foxy_ws/src/omorobot_r1_mini/src/ydlidar_ros2_driver/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
